    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will train a network to learn a language model and then use it to generate new sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of training the language model on text-documents (as it is the case in most examples) we will train it to learn the language of the music of [Johann_Sebastian_Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach).\n",
    "For this, we will learn how J. S. Bach's \"Cello suite\" have been composed.\n",
    "Here is an example of a \"Cello suite\" [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGQLXRTl3Z0).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rather than analyzing the audio signal, we use a symbolic representation of the \"Cello suite\" through their [MIDI files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI#MIDI_files).\n",
    "  - A MIDI file encodes in a file, the set of musical notes, their duration, and intensity which have to be played by each instrument to \"render\" a musical piece. The \"rendering\" is usually operated by a MIDI synthesizer (such as VLC, QuickTime).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will first train a language model on the whole set of MIDI files of the \"Cello suites\". \n",
    "- We will then sample this language model to create a new MIDI file which will be a brand new \"Cello suite\" composed by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bottom part of this lab, you will have to answer a set of questions. Answers to those only necessitates a couple of sentences."
